Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Copilot can help users engage with their content in a new and dynamic way—through audio. This new feature will enable Copilot to turn documents, meetings, and files into an audio overview, creating a listening experience that’s easy to follow. Users can ask Copilot to generate an audio overview in the Copilot chat pane, and Copilot will bring the content to life through a podcast-style discussion between two hosts who offer insightful commentary, draw connections between topics, and even exchange lively banter about the key points of their content. Soon, Copilot will also allow users to choose how they want to listen: select one or two speakers, adjust the style from concise to playful, and tailor the length to short, medium, or long. This capability is integrated directly into the tools users are familiar with—OneDrive, Teams, Word, and Copilot Notebooks—so it’s ready whenever and wherever they are.  </p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap IDs: <font color='#000000' style=''><a href='https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=487423' target='_blank' style=''>487423</a>, <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=478649' target='_blank' style=''>478649</a>, <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=485747' target='_blank' style=''>485747</a>, <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=487854' target='_blank' style=''>487854</a>, <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=490051' target='_blank' style=''>490051</a></font></p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide):</p><ul><li>This capability will begin rolling out in Copilot Notebooks on web for English only in May 2025 </li><li>This capability will begin rolling out for Copilot in OneDrive on web for English only in May 2025</li><li>This capability will begin rolling out for Copilot in Teams on desktop and mobile for English only in September 2025  </li><li>The podcast-style overview will begin rolling out for Copilot in Word on web and Windows desktop in May for English only.
